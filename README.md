# Credit Risk Analysis

In this week's project we will apply machine learning algorithms to solve a credit card risk problem.  This kind of problem is called imbalanced problem because there are much more credit cards with a low risk of credit compared with the ones with high risk. Therefore, we are going to use `imbalanced-learn` and `scikit-learn` libraries to build and evaluate classification models and sampling algorithms.

## Resampling Models to Predict Credit Risk

As it was established, an imbalanced dataset is a dataset where each output class is represented by different number of input samples. It is necessary to make a process for balancing the number of samples of the different classes. 
Three machine learning models, oversampling-`RandomOverSampler` and `SMOTE` ;
undersampling - `ClusterCentroids`.
